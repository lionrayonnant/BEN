# Mr.Robot
_This is my final project of TSTI2D._

You will need to download a last library who **is not included in my repo.**  
This is the **grove.py** library ( to use arduino script on python ).  
  
Make a **git clone** in your project folder with this command line :  
  
`git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/grove.py`
